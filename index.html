        Hi, my name is Christopher Biekeu, I am from from Montreal, Canada and I am a gratuate student here at New Mexico State University. 
        I recently got my bachelor's on computer science, and I am currently pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science as well. My fovorite 
        color is orange, I like this color alot because it represents my imagination, creativity, and good vibes. I feel like if I ever get asked 
        what color describes me best, orange is the color that would describe me best. <br><br> I am also part of the men's basketball team here at NMSU, I 
        am 6'8" tall and I weight about 225 lbs. I love basketball, I have been playing this sport since the age of 11 years old. There is also another 
        passion that I developed when I started college - coding. From crafting intricate software solutions to designing captivating websites, the realm 
        of coding ignites my imagination like no other. I also have a passion for coding smart contracts on the blockchain, I truly believe that with 
        the advancement of society, digital assets like cryptocurrencies will redefine how we transact, acquire goods, and manage finances in the future.
        <br><br> Feel free to navigate into the different pages to get to know me, see projects that I have done so far and my hobbies. There is also a 
        contact page so you can reach out to me if you ever you have a question. <br><br> Welcome, and enjoy the journey!
